# Netflix-clone
I developed a Netflix clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicates the streaming platform's user interface, featuring a sleek design with a homepage, movie carousels, and a responsive layout. It includes a search functionality, hover effects, and a dynamic display of movies and TV shows to enhance user experience.
